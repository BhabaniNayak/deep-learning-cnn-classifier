# deep-learning-cnn-classifier

In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project.

In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.

The notebook is broken down into separate steps.

Step 0: Import Datasets
Step 1: Detect Humans
Step 2: Detect Dogs
Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
Step 5: Write your Algorithm
Step 6: Test Your Algorithm
